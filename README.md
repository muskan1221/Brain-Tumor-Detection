# Brain-Tumor-Detection
Develop a Brain Tumor Detection System using machine learning, algorithms. The system is designed in
such a way that by inputting a set of brain MRI images into the system, we intend to train the model to
distinguish between positive and negative cases based on a labeled dataset. During the testing phase, the
trained model will analyze new MRI images, assigning a binary result of 0 for negative cases and 1 for
positive cases. The system's success will be measured by its ability to accurately classify brain images,
providing a reliable tool for early detection and categorization of brain tumors. Through this approach, 
we seek to create an efficient and automated solution that contributes to improved diagnostic precision in
the field of brain tumor detection.
The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture was chosen for its effectiveness in capturing spatial 
features in images.The model, implemented using the Keras library, consisted of multiple convolutional layers
with ReLU activation, max-pooling layers, and dense layers for classification.Dropout regularization was 
incorporated to mitigate overfitting, enhancing the model's generalization capabilities.
